Changes made so far for PCB v2 (as of 2/4/2025)

pin changes:
    CSN -> IO4
    MOSI -> IO5
    MISO -> IO6 
    CLK -> IO7
    RSTN -> IO19
    IRQ -> IO18

additions:
    - SW1 is the BOOT button, this will GND IO9 (PIN 8)
        for flash mode
    - SW2 is the RST button. Before we had to power cycle the 
        system which was inefficient, so this switch will ground it
    - There's an extra 01x02 pin header for extra GPIO
    - Added pull up resistor for the EN pin
